 Project Overview  
The EDENS Restaurant Website is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly  multi-page website designed to showcase a restaurant’s offerings. Built using HTML and CSS, it provides a well-structured layout that ensures seamless navigation and an engaging experience for visitors. The project consists of three main pages: Home, Menu, and Contact, each designed with a combination of CSS Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and animations for enhanced interactivity and responsiveness.

Page Descriptions  

1. Home Page (index.html)
The home page serves as the entry point for users, featuring a hero banner with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button. Using Flexbox, the page layout arranges an "About Us" section side by side with a featured dishes section to highlight the restaurant’s specialties. A navigation bar is included at the top and is consistent across all pages.
2. Menu Page (services.html)  
The menu page displays four service cards,  each representing different categorieS. The service cards are arranged using CSS Grid, ensuring a structured and visually appealing display. Each card consists of an image and heading  improving user engagement.

3. Contact Page (contact.html)  
The contact page contains a styled HTML5 form that allows users to input their name, email, subject, and message. The form is arranged using CSS Flexbox, ensuring a well-structured and responsive layout. The form also includes HTML5 validation, requiring users to enter valid input. Additionally, subtle animations are applied, such as a hover effect on the submit button. 

Summary of Features  

This project utilizes a variety of  CSS Selectors, including universal, class, ID, and element selectors, to style different components effectively. The navigation bar and homepage sections use Flexbox, while CSS Grid is implemented for the menu’s service cards to ensure a well-structured layout.

To make the website responsive, media queries are included at three breakpoints: 1024px (for tablets and small laptops), 768px (for smaller tablets), and 480px (for mobile devices). These ensure that the website adapts to different screen sizes, improving accessibility across various devices.

Additionally, CSS animations and transitions are incorporated throughout the project to enhance user experience. Keyframe animations are used for dynamic visual effects, while hover and focus transitions improve interaction, especially in the navigation bar, form elements, and service cards.
